# Segment Tree Visualizer

An interactive **Segment Tree** visualizer built with **Python** and **Streamlit** — designed to help you **learn**, **understand**, and **demonstrate** how segment trees work in real-time.

> Supports **range queries**, **point updates**, **range updates**, and dynamic visualization — all in a simple web app.

## Live Demo (Run Locally)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run segment_tree_app.py
```

No frontend knowledge needed — runs fully in Python on localhost!

## Features

- **Visualize Segment Trees** — Tree is auto-generated and updated using Graphviz.
- **Range Updates** — Add a value to all elements in a given range.
- **Point Updates** — Update a single element and reflect changes.
- **Range Queries** — Get sum over any subrange.
- **Interactive UI** — No need to touch code; everything is interactive.
- **Built with Streamlit** — Clean UI with minimal setup.

## What's a Segment Tree?

A **Segment Tree** is a powerful data structure that allows:

- Fast range queries (e.g., sum, min, max)
- Efficient point and range updates

It's widely used in:

- Competitive programming
- Financial systems (e.g., range price updates)
- Gaming (e.g., scoring)
- Real-time analytics
